    <PolicySection id="agreement" number="01" title="Agreement and scope">
      <p>By accessing or using www.example.com, you agree to these terms and to applicable law. If you do not agree, do not use the site. These terms cover public pages, forms, tools, APIs, newsletter features, Ask AI handoffs, the Muzix dashboard, account features, and integrations operated through this website.</p>
      <p>The site may change, experience downtime, or discontinue a feature. No promise is made that every feature will remain available, error-free, or compatible with every device.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="tools" number="02" title="Public tools and result accuracy">
      <p>IP, DNS, RDAP, TCP port, email-domain, font, Spotify preview, quote, and keyboard tools are provided for convenience and general information. Outputs may be incomplete, delayed, approximate, provider-dependent, or affected by VPNs, proxies, DNS caching, network filtering, browser restrictions, and third-party outages.</p>
      <PolicyList items={[
        'Do not rely on a tool result as the only basis for a legal, medical, financial, safety-critical, or production-security decision.',
        'Mailfy verifies syntax and domain mail routing; it does not confirm that a mailbox exists or belongs to a person.',
        'IP geolocation is approximate and may identify a provider gateway rather than a physical location.',
        'The keyboard tester runs in the browser, but operating-system and browser shortcuts may be intercepted before the page receives them.',
      ]} />
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="acceptable" number="03" title="Acceptable use and testing authorization">
      <p>You must not use the site to violate law, invade privacy, infringe intellectual property, distribute malware, send spam, overload infrastructure, evade access controls, scrape protected data, or interfere with another person’s use.</p>
      <p>Use the port checker only against a public system you own or are expressly authorized to test. Do not attempt to bypass private-address protections, rate limits, request limits, or other safeguards. Automated access must remain reasonable and must stop if it affects service stability.</p>
      <p>The Spotify preview uses the official player. Despite the legacy tool slug “spotmp3,” it is not an MP3 converter and does not grant permission to download, extract, record, convert, circumvent protection, or redistribute audio. Follow Spotify’s terms and the rights of artists and other rights holders.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="accounts" number="04" title="Accounts and connected services">
      <p>Some restricted features may require GitHub or Discord sign-in, while CORE WEB’s private administration can connect Spotify to publish the Muzix dashboard. Use only accounts you control, follow each provider’s terms, and do not bypass authorization, OAuth state, session, or role checks.</p>
      <p>You are responsible for securing your provider account and device. Notify CORE WEB if you reasonably believe a session or connected feature has been misused. Access may be restricted to protect the site or investigate abuse.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="submissions" number="05" title="Contact messages and other submissions">
      <p>You retain rights you already have in content you submit. You give CORE WEB permission to process contact messages, newsletter addresses, tool inputs, and other submissions as reasonably needed to respond, provide the requested feature, protect the site, and meet legal obligations.</p>
      <p>Newsletter messages may include an unsubscribe link. You may unsubscribe at any time, and you must not subscribe another person without their permission or misuse subscription endpoints for spam, harassment, or automated testing.</p>
      <p>Submit only content you have the right to share. Do not submit secrets, passwords, one-time codes, full card data, unlawful content, threats, malware, or another person’s confidential information without authorization.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="ownership" number="06" title="Site content, brand, and open source">
      <p>The core-web name, site design, original writing, photographs, video, and other original materials remain protected by applicable intellectual-property law. Third-party names, media, fonts, embeds, and software remain owned by their respective rights holders.</p>
      <p>Source code published in the core-web-in-1 repository is governed by the license included with that repository. A source-code license does not automatically grant rights to the CORE WEB brand, private credentials, personal media, or third-party assets.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="services" number="07" title="Third-party services and links">
      <p>The site relies on or links to providers for hosting, analytics, DNS, identity, storage, email, fonts, media, music, network data, and quotes. Their availability, accuracy, policies, and acts are outside CORE WEB’s direct control. Your use of a provider is also governed by that provider’s terms.</p>
      <p>The Ask AI launcher prepares the current page title, description, public www.example.com URL, and your question for a third-party AI service that you choose. CORE WEB does not operate those models, control their responses, or guarantee that an answer is accurate, complete, or suitable for your purpose. Review important answers independently, and do not put passwords, confidential material, or sensitive personal data in an AI prompt.</p>
      <p>The Muzix dashboard displays data supplied by Spotify and can update while you view it. Playback state, rankings, counts, availability, artwork, and listening summaries may be delayed, incomplete, or changed by Spotify. Music, artwork, artist names, and Spotify marks remain subject to their respective rights and platform terms.</p>
      <p>Links do not imply endorsement, and CORE WEB is not responsible for content or transactions on an external website.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="paid" number="08" title="Paid project work and refunds">
      <p>Public tool access does not create a consulting relationship. Paid work begins only when the parties agree to a proposal, invoice, statement of work, or another clear arrangement. That document may define scope, milestones, revisions, ownership, warranties, payment timing, and cancellation terms.</p>
      <p>The <Link href="/legal/refund">Refund Policy</Link> applies to eligible direct payments unless project-specific written terms say otherwise.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="liability" number="09" title="Disclaimers and limits">
      <p>The site is provided on an “as available” basis. To the extent permitted by law, CORE WEB disclaims implied warranties and is not responsible for indirect, incidental, special, or consequential loss arising from tool output, downtime, data loss, third-party conduct, or use outside the documented purpose.</p>
      <p>Nothing here excludes liability or a legal remedy that cannot be excluded. If a limitation is not enforceable where you live, it applies only to the maximum extent allowed there.</p>
      <PolicyCallout title="Use professional judgment">You remain responsible for validating results, maintaining backups, securing credentials, and obtaining permission before testing a system.</PolicyCallout>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="changes" number="10" title="Changes, governing law, and contact">
      <p>These terms may be updated by publishing a revised version here. Continued use after an update constitutes acceptance to the extent permitted by law. Material paid-project rights are not retroactively changed where a separate written agreement controls.</p>
      <p>Replace this section with the governing law and dispute process appropriate for your location, services, and users. Mandatory consumer and other legal protections may still apply.</p>
      <p>Questions can be sent to <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a>. Information about data handling appears in the <Link href="/legal/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>, and vulnerability reports belong on the <Link href="/legal/security">Security page</Link>.</p>

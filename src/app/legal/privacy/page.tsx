    <PolicySection id="scope" number="01" title="Scope, operator, and contact">
      <p>This policy covers www.example.com, its public forms and tools, website authentication, newsletter features, Ask AI handoffs, the Muzix dashboard, and connected profile services operated by CORE WEB. Separate policies may apply to a Discord application, a client project, or a third-party website.</p>
      <p>Questions or requests about information handled through this site can be sent to <a href="mailto:support@example.com">support@example.com</a>. This notice describes the current product; it is not a blanket certification under every privacy law.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="collect" number="02" title="Information the site handles">
      <PolicyList items={[
        <><strong>Contact:</strong> name, email address, and message are validated and relayed through Gmail so CORE WEB can respond.</>,
        <><strong>Newsletter:</strong> email address, subscription status, audience reference, unsubscribe record, and a hash of the unsubscribe token are handled through Resend and Supabase. The address or its domain may be checked through Mailcheck and public MX records to reduce abuse.</>,
        <><strong>Sign-in:</strong> identity details returned by GitHub or Discord, OAuth state, session information, and access roles are used to establish and protect your session.</>,
        <><strong>Technical requests:</strong> IP address, user agent, requested route, timestamps, and similar request details may be processed by hosting, security, authentication, and delivery providers.</>,
        <><strong>Connected features:</strong> profile integrations may process data returned by Spotify, Discord/Lanyard, YouTube, or weather services when those features are enabled. Public Muzix responses can include CORE WEB’s playback state, track and artist data, playlists, recently played items, liked-song count, and listening summaries.</>,
      ]} />
      <p>Do not submit passwords, full payment-card details, government identifiers, health information, or other sensitive information through ordinary contact fields.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="tools" number="03" title="How the public tools process requests">
      <p>Tool inputs are used to produce the result you request. The application does not intentionally create a user profile from tool history, although hosting and upstream providers may keep ordinary security or operational logs.</p>
      <PolicyList items={[
        <><strong>IP lookup:</strong> the request IP and browser details are returned to you; public network information is enriched through ipwho.is.</>,
        <><strong>DNS and registration:</strong> domains and record types are sent to Cloudflare DNS-over-HTTPS and, when requested, RDAP services.</>,
        <><strong>Port checker:</strong> the public hostname or IP and TCP port are resolved and tested from the server. The target host will receive the connection attempt.</>,
        <><strong>Mailfy:</strong> the submitted address is checked for syntax and its domain is queried for MX records; the mailbox is not contacted or proven to exist.</>,
        <><strong>Font UI:</strong> the chosen Google Font is requested from Google Fonts. Preview text remains in your browser.</>,
        <><strong>Spotify preview and quotes:</strong> Spotify links use Spotify’s official embed and do not provide audio conversion or downloads; random quotes are requested from DummyJSON.</>,
        <><strong>Keytest:</strong> key presses, history, RGB settings, and statistics remain in browser memory and are not sent to a tool API.</>,
        <><strong>Ask AI:</strong> the page title, description, public URL, and your question are assembled into a prompt in your browser. Selecting a provider copies that prompt and opens its website; ChatGPT may also receive it through its prefilled web address.</>,
        <><strong>Muzix:</strong> the browser requests a server-generated view of CORE WEB’s Spotify data. Spotify access and refresh tokens stay on the server; visitors do not connect their own Spotify account through the public chart.</>,

    <PolicySection id="analytics" number="04" title="Web analytics and infrastructure logs">
      <p>The site uses Vercel Web Analytics to measure page views and Vercel Speed Insights to understand real-world loading and interaction performance. According to <a href="https://vercel.com/docs/analytics/privacy-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Vercel’s Analytics privacy documentation</a>, Web Analytics does not use third-party cookies, records anonymous data points, and uses a request-derived visitor hash that is discarded after 24 hours.</p>
      <p>Measurement data may include timestamp, route or URL, referrer, filtered query information, approximate geolocation, device type, operating system, browser, and performance metrics such as page-loading or interaction timings. It is not intended to identify a visitor or reconstruct browsing across unrelated sites. No custom measurement event currently asks for contact-form content, email addresses, Ask AI questions, or keytest input.</p>
      <p>Vercel, Cloudflare, and other infrastructure providers may separately process IP addresses, request headers, errors, and security logs to deliver the site, prevent abuse, and diagnose failures under their own terms.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="cookies" number="05" title="Cookies and local browser storage">
      <p>Essential HTTP-only cookies may be used for sign-in sessions and OAuth security state. The homepage cookie banner saves <strong>core-web_cookie_choice</strong>, the selected mode, a timestamp, and a preference-version number in local storage so the banner does not appear on every visit. The current “Accept” and “Essential only” buttons record that preference; this build does not install an advertising cookie.</p>
      <p>Vercel Web Analytics and Speed Insights operate without an CORE WEB advertising cookie and are not currently switched by the banner choice. Third-party embeds or connected services may use their own storage after you open or activate those features. Blocking cookies, local storage, or measurement scripts may prevent sign-in, preference persistence, embedded playback, or analytics collection.</p>
      <PolicyCallout title="Browser controls">You can remove local storage and cookies through your browser. Clearing the stored choice causes the banner to appear again.</PolicyCallout>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="providers" number="06" title="Service providers and international processing">
      <p>Providers are used only where needed to host the site or deliver requested features. They currently include Vercel, Cloudflare, Supabase, Resend, Gmail/Google, Mailcheck, GitHub, Discord, Spotify, ipwho.is, public DNS and RDAP operators, DummyJSON, and Google Fonts. The optional Ask AI launcher links to OpenAI ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, and xAI Grok.</p>
      <p>Nothing is sent to an AI provider merely by opening the launcher. When you select a provider, its website opens and the prepared prompt is copied for you to paste; ChatGPT may receive the prompt in its prefilled URL. Anything you paste or submit is then processed under that provider’s privacy policy. Do not include secrets or sensitive personal information in a question.</p>
      <p>These providers may process information in countries where they or their subprocessors operate. Their privacy notices, retention periods, and legal safeguards apply to their processing. Links to third-party sites are not controlled by CORE WEB.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="retention" number="07" title="Purposes, disclosure, and retention">
      <p>Information is used to deliver requested features, respond to inquiries, maintain subscriptions, establish sessions, operate integrations, prevent abuse, measure aggregate traffic, and meet legal obligations. CORE WEB does not sell personal information or provide it to an advertising network for targeted advertising.</p>
      <p>Information is kept only as long as needed for the feature, support, security, opt-out record, project relationship, or legal obligation. Contact messages may remain in the receiving mailbox; newsletter services may keep subscription or suppression records; infrastructure providers keep logs under their own schedules. The application does not promise one universal deletion period for every provider.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="rights" number="08" title="Your choices and privacy requests">
      <p>You can unsubscribe using the link in a newsletter. You may email CORE WEB to request access to, correction of, or deletion of information you submitted. Enough information may be requested to verify the request and locate the relevant record.</p>
      <p>Some records may be retained where needed to honor an opt-out, protect the service, resolve a dispute, or comply with law. Depending on where you live, additional objection, restriction, portability, complaint, or consent-withdrawal rights may apply.</p>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="security" number="09" title="Security, children, and policy changes">
      <p>Technical and organizational safeguards are used in proportion to the site’s features, but no transmission or storage system can be guaranteed completely secure. Please report suspected vulnerabilities through the <Link href="/legal/security">Security page</Link>.</p>
      <p>The public site is not designed to knowingly collect information from children below the minimum age required by applicable law. This policy may be updated as features or providers change; the date above identifies the current version.</p>

    <PolicySection id="approach" number="01" title="Security approach">
      <p>Security is treated as an ongoing engineering process rather than a guarantee or certification. Controls are selected for the site’s actual risk: public forms and utilities, newsletter delivery, administrator-only features, GitHub, Discord and Spotify OAuth connections, public music data, and third-party infrastructure.</p>
      <p>No internet service is completely secure. This page describes controls visible in the current application and avoids claiming a specific audit result, cipher suite, recovery target, or compliance certification that has not been independently verified.</p>

    <PolicySection id="web" number="02" title="Web and browser safeguards">
      <PolicyList items={[
        <><strong>Encrypted transport:</strong> the deployed site is served over HTTPS and sends a long-lived HSTS policy.</>,
        <><strong>Content controls:</strong> Content Security Policy limits scripts, frames, fonts, media, connections, and other resources to approved sources; the Vercel toolbar origin is allowed only on preview deployments.</>,
        <><strong>Browser isolation:</strong> frame, content-type, referrer, permissions, opener, and cross-domain policy headers reduce common browser attack paths.</>,
        <><strong>Safer rendering:</strong> user-supplied contact content is validated, length-limited, and HTML-escaped before it is relayed.</>,
      ]} />
      <PolicyCallout title="About CSP">The current Next.js build still requires inline framework scripts. Moving to a nonce-based strict CSP is a future hardening option and would require request-time nonce propagation across the application.</PolicyCallout>
    </PolicySection>

    <PolicySection id="data" number="03" title="Data, identity, and privileged access">
      <p>Secrets, email credentials, OAuth client secrets, and Spotify access or refresh tokens are expected to remain in server-side environment configuration and are not intentionally exposed to client JavaScript. Authentication uses provider-backed OAuth flows, security-state checks, HTTP-only cookies where applicable, and server-side authorization for restricted routes.</p>
      <p>Public Muzix responses contain selected listening information rather than credentials. Operational data is handled through providers such as Vercel, Cloudflare, Supabase, Resend, Gmail, GitHub, Discord, and Spotify. Those systems maintain their own infrastructure controls. Access should be limited to what is required to operate and support the site.</p>

        'Public API requests use route-specific validation, rate limits where applicable, and explicit JSON body-size limits.',

        'Newsletter submissions validate address format, limit attempts, reject known disposable or prohibited addresses, and issue a tokenized unsubscribe link.',
        'The TCP port checker requires an authorization acknowledgement, resolves the target server-side, and blocks private, local, reserved, and mixed-address targets.',

    <PolicySection id="report" number="05" title="Report a suspected vulnerability">
      <p>Send a private report to <a href="mailto:support@example.com?subject=Security%20report">support@example.com</a> with “Security report” in the subject. Include the affected www.example.com URL or feature, a concise description, reproducible steps, expected impact, and any safe proof-of-concept material.</p>
      <p>Do not include personal data copied from another user, active credentials, destructive payloads, or a public disclosure link. If sensitive evidence is necessary, first ask for a safer transfer method.</p>

    <PolicySection id="research" number="06" title="Good-faith research boundaries">
      <p>CORE WEB welcomes good-faith reports that minimize harm. Researchers should stop once a vulnerability is confirmed and allow reasonable time for investigation before publication.</p>

    <PolicySection id="response" number="07" title="Triage, remediation, and limitations">
      <p>Reports are prioritized by reproducibility, affected data, required access, and realistic impact. CORE WEB may ask follow-up questions, deploy temporary mitigations, coordinate with a hosting provider, or close reports that are informational, duplicate, outside scope, or not reproducible.</p>
      <p>Security controls and provider configurations evolve. This page is not a warranty that every issue will be prevented, discovered, or resolved within a fixed time. Suspected account compromise or unlawful activity may also be reported to the relevant provider or authority.</p>
